## SHA1 Hashes with Brute Force

Code a Python 2.7 program that breaks SHA1 hashes in a brute force manner.

To break the SHA1 hash with brute force, my code loads a file containing a list of the top 1,000,000 top password from the your directory. It then compares a hash, given in the form of an argument, and compare the hashed password with each password in the file till it finds a match.
